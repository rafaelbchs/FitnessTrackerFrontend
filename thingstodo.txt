MVP (MAIN GOALS)
Routes

As any user when browsing the app, I want to

click links/tabs that display different parts of the app.
see the route I am visiting in the url bar (i.e. Routines tab should have a route https://example.com/routines)
stay on the "same page", while seeing the content update (i.e. use React Router, no page refresh)
see Components/Tabs with corresponding routes:

Home
Routines
My Routines
Activities
Login/Register (optional. Could be alternatively created as a modal or part of the header/footer)
User

As an unregistered visitor I want to:

see a Sign Up/Sign In form in the header/footer, on a tab (with or without matching route) or in a modal
be able to sign up for a new account with valid username/password combination
see meaningful messages if there are errors during registration, so that I may correct them
see tabbed navigation for Routines and Activities (with matching routes)

As a registered user I want to:

be able to log in with my username/password combination
see meaningful messages if there are errors during login, so that I may correct them
stay logged in between page visits (for example, if I close my browser, and come back later)
be able to log out if I am logged in
see tabbed navigation for Routines, My Routines (once logged in), and Activities (with matching routes)
